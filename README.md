# current-foxos-struicture-

**4. Great-Foxlabratory** - The actual implementation layer with:
* `command-tower` (your control/orchestration)
* `secret-foxlabs` (experimental stuff)
* Theme management system that's WAY more elaborate than most people's entire configs   foxlabs is mostly ecpiri,mentralareas that are not fit to officially belong out in the wild andits split hence ther secret (mad scietist crazy ambitiose  not embarassed to fail and get outthere territroty whcuh doesnt inhibit and encourages creativity and no limits...throw it in their  its okay and safe   labs..are when ytou actuall start to twest  those and wathc them blow up ad explode in a comeplte safe space and ephemeral (its the paln or conatianeized 'Incus' lab area so when / if it blows up foxos isnt scathed .....)  and then when or if anyrthign oif these persist and become cannoin then is implemented into fox os cleanly     was the idea so dont take worth and judnement toharh on the lab area vs official foxos   same for librabry  tahts why their grouped together (G)-wise to couple them structurly and keep them foxos_but not "FoXoS"
