# 🕯️ TORCH.md — The Living Canon of FoxOS

## What This Is

**FoxOS** is not a distro. It's not a theme. It's a **representational operating system** built around intention, not convention. A spatial, semantic, and symbolic filesystem layered over declarative, reproducible infrastructure.

This file is the canon. It documents the **why**, not the syntax. This is the torch we carry — the principles behind the structure.

## 🔥 Core Philosophy

- **Everything Is Spatial**  
  Files aren’t just files — they’re *locations*. A temple isn’t lore. It’s the config sanctum. A workshop isn’t just build scripts — it’s where the system transforms.

- **Metaphor Is Mechanic**  
  Symbolism here isn’t aesthetic. It’s semantic compression. A name carries architecture. `foxfrost-village` isn’t cute. It’s a zone of userland templates, interfaces, and shared tools.

- **flake2 is Real**  
  `flake2.nix` is not a joke. It’s the real, extended, opinionated flake interface. `flake.nix` exists to bootstrap. `flake2` is the operator.

- **Structure Over Stories**  
  There is no lore in the core. Only role. Stories emerge if you want them — but function is the sovereign layer.

## 🗺️ Structural Zones (Simplified)

- `frostflake/` → The control tower. Houses `flake.nix` + `flake2.nix` + channels/meta/extensions.
- `foxfrost-village/` → Userland commons. Templates, shared configs, docs, interaction points.
- `frostcore-mountains/` → Tooling, dev environments, experiments. Where real builds happen.
- `frostfall/` → Init + modules. Core boot + system/home declarations.
- `snowflake/` → Flake packaging zone. Store systems, overlays, hosts.
- `.foxfiles/` → Project dotfile storage. Home-managed, cloud-safe, stow-able.

## 🧠 Canonical Principles

- **Don’t chase FHS.** You’re not Linux. You’re FoxOS.
- **Use names with purpose.** If it sounds silly, but it fits — it stays.
- **Never bloat. Never LARP.** If the structure doesn’t serve, scrap it.
- **Make it bootable.** Theory is fun, but builds gotta work.

## ✊ Final Word

This isn’t a project. It’s a **mental architecture**.
The metaphor is structural. The naming is deliberate.  
**FoxOS is the interface for your own internal system.**  
Treat it with the respect you'd want your OS to return.
